# 🗨️ Chat Logger (Python Mini Project)

This is a Python-based mini project that acts like a **terminal-based chat app**. It allows two users to simulate a chat, and all messages are saved in a text file with proper timestamps. Ideal for beginners who are exploring file handling and basic Python logic.

---

## 📌 Features:

- Accepts user input (name + message)
- Adds timestamps using Python's `datetime` module
- Saves conversations in a `.txt` file (`chat_log.txt`)
- Appends new chats without deleting old ones

---

## 💻 Technologies Used:

- Python (core)
- File Handling
- `datetime` module

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Step 1: Open terminal or Pydroid (for Android)
# Step 2: Run the scrip
